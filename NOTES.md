#### Versija, kur finansų sistema nėra ekonomikos dalis iš viso. (Ji pridaro daugiau problemų, nei sprendimų).

My KISS version of out economy:

GDP is the measure of our PRODUCTIVE economy. GDP is the sum of household, business and government spending (and likewise the income of those sectors equals that spending, because ALL spending is someone else's income). Our economy depends on household spending (2/3 of GDP). That spending is limited by household income (which comes only from those three sectors). Business provides that income to the extent demand (business opportunity) exists, and government provides the rest (by way of bookkeeping entries to household bank accounts). All that's important to the economy is maintaining this flow, and with a fiat currency (whose value, by definition, depends ONLY on currency-users perception), there are no limits other than that perception.

Note that the financial sector is not a part of that economy - & not by my choice but by NIPA definition. And can you see any rational reason from that description that small businesses cannot fulfill those household wants/needs as well (or better) than the oligopolies?

#### Citata apie Reigano eroje išaukštintą "save reguliuojančios rinkos ekonomikos" krizę
So we’re in a very different environment from 2008. Back then, bankers and businessmen were panicking as their Reagan-era ideological assumption that markets were natural phenomena clashed with a collapsing financial system requiring political action. Today, the illusions are gone.
